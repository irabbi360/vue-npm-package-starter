# Vue NPM Package Starter

## Create and Publish a Vue NPM Package

## Test the Library
We can now run `npm run build` and then test out our library. To do this, open up a Vue project (you can open a current Vue 3 project you have, or create a blank one).

## How to Publish to NPM

If you haven't signed into NPM inside your terminal you can do that by running the `npm adduser` command.

Then just run the `npm publish` command and the package should be pushed up and made available on NPM.
